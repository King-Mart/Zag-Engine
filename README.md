# Zig-Zag engine
#### This is a game engine mainly made to learn how game engines function and make my production of games faster.

It was made in zig in order to force me to understand further the concepts I am using to make it.\
It will heavily be inspired by the Unreal Engine for the 3D part, Unity for 2D and Godot for ease of use and appeal

# How to build it:
#### Thanks to Zig's build steps it is quite easy to build it!
1. Make sure you have Zig 0.13 installed
2. Then clone this repository
3. Open terminal in the root ofthe engine (the directory containing build.zig)
4. Then run `zig build` in the terminal
Inside the zig-out/bin dirctory, you will find gameEngine.exe that you can run

# TODO
* Add releases so it is easier to install
* Make a website for documentation
